# Windows Registry

Windows Registry is a database where Windows and many programs store their configuration settings. 

Windows Registry is a collection of several databases including system-wide registry settings that apply to all users and each Windows user account also has its own user-specific settings. 

The registry contains folder-like "keys" and "values" inside those keys that contain numbers, text, or other data. 
Most Windows users will never need to touch the registry. The registry is a big mess of a database and its difficult to find what your looking for. 

Editing the registry isn't dangerous if you know what you're doing. Make sure to backup the registry and computer before editing the registry, just in case. 

## How to edit the registry

1. In the Windows search bar, search "regedit"
2. The left panel is the keys and to the right is the name of the value and you can double click it to change its value.

You can edit the registry by downloading and running .reg files, which contain a change that's applied when you run them. You should only download and run .reg files from sources you trust. Better yet, you can create your own registry hack files to change different settings and automatically apply it.
