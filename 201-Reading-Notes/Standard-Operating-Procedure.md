# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
The standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure that is specific to your company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task.

## Three types of documents that should be in an SOP manual:
* Policy- Answers "Why?" Provides broad, overarching guidance.
* SOP- Answers "What, when, and why" What needs to be done, when does it need to be done, and why is it being done. There may be multiple SOPs that support a specific policy.
* Work Instructions- Answers "How" A work instruction (WI) provides the step-by-step directions for accomplishing a particular task. There may be multiple sets of work instructions that support a specific SOP.

## Why are SOPs so Important?
SOPs are a primary way to implement or enforce a policy. Policies are intended to steer an organization to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of an organization, but without SOPs, are not actionable. SOPs also encourage consistency in execution, which is critical for demonstrating compliance with or achievement of targets described in a service level agreement.

## Challenges in Writing SOPs
1. Most significant challenge in writing SOPs is that there are no hard and fast rules for writing them. A format or writing style that works for one organization may not work as well with another organization.
2. SOPs can become out of date very quickly if not regularly maintained. The business is ever-changing and evolving, and as a result, IT changes and evolves as well. If not maintained as part of those changes, they will become obsolete.

## Things to Consider
* Readable- This means legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings and effective use of whitespace.
* Consumable- Using a template or predefined format makes the content easy to read.
* Understandable- To be effective, SOPs must be focused and to the point, using relevant, but simple terms
* Actionable- SOPs must clearly and succinctly describe what is to be done.
* Measurable- The activities described within an SOP must be specific and measurable.

## Plan for Writing an SOP
1. Draw a simple flowchart to map the activities of the procedure from beginning to end. This helps form the outline and scope of the SOP as well as confirm the sequence of activities.
2. Combine any closely-related topics so that the SOP becomes more concise and readable. For example, the flowchart may depict an activity for capturing a caller's name, followed by an activity for capturing the caller's contact information, followed by an activity for capturing location. These three activities could be under a single activity.
3. Check to ensure the right balance regarding the number of activities within the SOP. If you don't have enough detail, the SOP is useless; it's not worth reading. If you have too much detail, the SOP is useless; no one will read it. Recommend keeping an SOP in the general range of five to seven steps.
4. Revise the flowchart to reflect the actual number of steps and number each step.
5. Write a brief, opening overview paragraph that briefly describes the topic of the SOP, inputs, output, expected results, and involved roles.

## Five Guiding Principles
* Keep it simple- The SOP is likely to be referenced while handling a customer contact, SOP should augment and reinforce training, it is not a substitute for training.
* SOPs must be portable- Even if an underpinning application or tool is changed, the "what, when and why" generally will not
* Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story- People learn and interpret information in different ways. Some people like to read it, some like the diagrams and flowchart and some like the big picture.
* Consistency counts- Develop and use a consistent format or template to help make the SOP consumable
* It's about the audience- When writing the SOP, keep in mind that you're writing them for your audience. If the SOP does not work for your audience, your SOP doesn't work.
