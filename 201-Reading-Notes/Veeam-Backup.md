10. File level recovery from backup
11. Whole VM recovery from backup
12. VM file recovery from backup (VMX, VHD, VMDK, etc.)

## Veeam Backup Free Edition can be summarized in these three powerful categories:
* **VeeamZIP** - Creates an ad-hoc backup of a running VM, which gives you many benefits such as being able to easily copy a backup to another host without having to power off the original VM
* **Powerful and flexible restores** - Supports a number of recovery scenarios, including recovery of an entire VM, guest OS files and individual application items
* **Quick Migration (VMware)** - migrates a live VM between hosts or datastores with minimal downtime and without requiring clusters, shared storage, or even VMware vMotion or Storage vMotion

## VeeamZIP
VeeamZIP delivers technology that lets you create backups of running VMs. With VeeamZIP, you have to specify only two things - the Vm you want to backup and where your resulting backup file will go! The backup will be deduplicated and compressed, resulting in significantly lower backup storage requirements. VeeamZIP is very efficient. The processing engine is fast, and optimizations include parallel processing of virtual disks, filtering out empty blocks, and more.  
VeeamZIP is helpful when:
* You need to update a VM
* You need to archive a VM
* You need to copy a VM to a remote host or test lab.

## Powerful and flexible restores
Veeam Backup Free Edition supports several data recovery scenarios, beginning with recovery of a VM file and going all the way to restoring an entire VM. The list includes:
* Restoring VM files
* Restoring an entire VM
* Restoring VM disks (VMware)
* Restoring guest OS files

## Quick Migration (VMware)
Quick Migration lets you migrate live VMs between hosts or datastores without requiring clusters, shared storage or advanced functionality that is not available in lower-level hypervisor editions. Quick Migration works well even in environments with slow or high latency connections that prevent VMware vMotion and Hyper-V Live Migration from working.
