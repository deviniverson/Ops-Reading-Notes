# SSD Data Recovery Best Practices

## How do I know if my SSD is failing?
SSD failures are hard to detect, unlike UDDs, SSDs do not emit audible signals like whirring, clicking, or humming when they're approaching a complete shutdown. SSDs can operate in silene until they simply stop functioning. 
Most common indicators that your SSD may be approaching its read/write cycle limit:

* Bad Blocks: storage segments that, through memory corruption or physical damage, impede data storage and retrieval functions. 
An SSD suffering from bad blocks may exhibit a few key symptoms:
* Saving, reading, and moving files may result in failure
* Active applications may operate slowly or frequently crash
* The user may recieve prompts to repair the file system
* Gerneral performance may steadily decrease, especially when handling large files

## How to fix a failed SSD?

How to approach fixing an SSD that is failing to perform properly depends on the source of its issues. If its something phyically damaged or it has degraded flach cells, the SSD may need to be replaced. If its a dysfunction derived from a logical error - bad blocks, software malfunctions, malware, outdated firmware, etc. - a handful of techniques may achieve SSD recovery.

* Formatting the drive and redownloading the operating system
* Power cycling the SSD, if the SSD drive becomes corrupted through power failure, try this:
    1. Unplug the SATA data cable, but leave the power cable in.
    2. Leave the power on for half an hour, then turn it off for 30 seconds.
    3. Turn the power back on again for another half hour, then turn it off for 30 seconds.
    4. Turn the power back on and reconnect the data cable. 
    5. If power cycling has been effective, the SSD will be back up at that point.

* Idling in the boot menu, this method is similar to power cycling, except that when the power is on during the half-hour intervals, the computer should be left to idle in the boot menu.
    * On a PC, boot into BIOS and sit at the BIOS screen.
    * On a Mac, get to the boot menu by turning on the computer while holding down the ALT key.

* Update SSD firmware, Run a firmware update tool to check whether the SSD has the latest version. If it doesn't, install it and wait to see if functionality (and data access) is restored. If firmware becomes too damaged, even professionals cannot reverse its effects, and data may be lost forever. 
* Update drivers, In Windows, simply check the Device Manager, go to Disk Drives and right click the SSD to update the driver. After rebooting, you may be able to see the revived SSD.

## SSD protection best practices
1. Download a program from a selection of existing free software options designed to monitor SSD health by tracking operating temperature and performance metrics.
2. Invest in a new SSD, buy strategically. Many SSDs come equipped with S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, Reporting Technology) that warns users of potential failure and prompts them to take preventative mearusres.
3. Have a backup strategy. Backup data regularly and routinely.
