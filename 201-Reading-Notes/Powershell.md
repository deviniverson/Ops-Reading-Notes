# PowerShell

PowerShell is a command-line shell interface made by Microsoft that enables system administrators and power users to manage computers form the command line. PowerShell is also a scripting language, built on .NET which can be used for automating administrative tasks and configuration management. PowerShell tasks are generally performed using cmdlets which can perform a wide variety of actions. These comdlets can perform something as simple as evaluating the size of a file, to spinning up hundreds of servers in the cloud.

The commonality between typical compiled languages (like JavaScript, Java, Python, C# and Ruby) is that they create something. A desktop application, a web application, a website, a game, or a mobile app.

PowerShell is an interpreted language for doing things, typically in the context of managing a technology environment. A developer will develop an application in C#, but the application might run on a fleet of servers, or native cloud technology that an engineer deploys and manages with PowerShell.

## Jobs that leverage the use of PowerShell:

·         Systems Administrator

·         Network Administrator

·         Systems Engineer

·         Site Reliability Engineer

·         Systems Development Engineer

·         Cloud Architect

·         System Architect

## PowerShell vs Bash

Bash is the shell primarily used in Linux. It combines a scripting language, as well as a host of native Linux tools to automate and manage Linux devices. PowerShell is a Microsoft command-line shell and associated scripting language used for task automation and configuration management. Bash works with strings; PowerShell works with Objects. Both Bash and PowerShell rely on the concept of the pipeline. PowerShell pipes objects, passing along the output of one cmdlet as the input for another one. This means PowerShell pushes around structured data, while Bash shells push around globs of text.

# IBM says most hackers just PowerShell through boxes now, leaving little in the way of footprints.

Direct-to-memory attacks now account for 57% of hacks.

PowerShell is useful in data collection and analysis, but it is also favored by malicious actors who use it to forego the file system and inject malicious code directly into memory, thus enhancing obfuscation, and often evading security controls designed to detect malware deployments. Threat actors of all skill levels have expanded their capabilities using PowerShell over the next few years. IBM X-Force IRIS has seen cases wherein complete malicious toolkits were contained within PowerShell scripts.

In some cases, crooks wouldn’t even need to run a super-leet exploit to steal corporate data. In addition to exposed files and records, misconfigurations could also indirectly lead to other attacks when things like passwords and email addresses are involved and used to login to other accounts on other services to carry out further mischief.
