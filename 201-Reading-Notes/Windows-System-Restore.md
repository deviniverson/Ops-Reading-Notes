System Restore in Windows

# System Restore in Windows
 
The System Restore tool in Windows is one of the more useful utilities available. This tool lets you revert to a previous software, registry, and driver configuration (called a restore point). It can undo the last major change to Windows, taking your computer back to the way it was when the restore point was created. System Restore is a great tool to use early in the troubleshooting process because the majority of Windows problems involve issues with at least one of those aspects of the operating system.
The System Restore tool to undo/reverse changes in Windows usually takes anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes, in most cases.

## How to use System Restore:
1. Open Control Panel
2. Select System and Security
3. Select System
4. Choose System protection
5. Press System Restore
6. Press Next
7. Select the restore point you want to use from the list.
8. Press Next
9. Press Finish
10. Choose Yes to start System Restore, can’t be interrupted once started.
11. Your computer will show an empty screen with messages of Windows files and changes being restored. This will take around 15 minutes.
12. Computer will restart
13. Sign into Windows as you normally do
14. Select Close
15. Now the System Restore is complete, check to see that whatever issue you were trying to fix is corrected.

**Important!** If you’re running System Restore from Safe Mode, please know that changes it makes to your computer will not be reversible.
Note: Your computer will restart as part of a System Restore, so be sure to close anything you might have running now.

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Type this command in the Command Prompt window: rstrui.exe
