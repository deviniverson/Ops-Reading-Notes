# How to remove malware from your Windows PC

The signs of a PC plagued by malware:

* Slower-than-usual performance

* A sudden spate of pop-ups

* Other anomalous issues

 

Out-of-the-ordinary behavior is sometimes the result of hardware conflicts, but your first action should be to rule out the possibility of infection by a virus, spyware, or other nefarious entity-even if you have an antivirus program installed.

 

## Step by step guide on how to get rid of malware

 

### Step 1: Enter Safe Mode

Before doing anything you will need to disconnect your PC from the internet and don’t use it till you’re ready to clean your PC. This will help prevent the malware from spreading and/or leaking your private data. Boot your Pc into Microsoft’s Safe Mode. In this mode, only the minimum required programs and services are loaded. This is important because it can make removing the nefarious files easier since they’re not actually running or active.

 

### Step 2: Delete temporary files

Now in Safe Mode, delete your temporary files then run a virus scan.  This may speed up the virus scanning, free up disk space, and even get rid of some malware. To use the Disk Cleanup utility included with Windows 10 just type Disk Cleanup in the search bar or after pressing the start button and select the tool that appears named Disk Cleanup.

### Step 3: Download malware scanners

Now its time to run an malware scanner and let it do some work and fortunately, running a scanner is enough to remove most standard infections. If you already have an anitvirus program active on your computer, you should use a different scanner for this malware check, since your current antivirus software may not have detected the malware. No anitvirus program can detect 100% of the millions of malware types and variants. 

### Step 4: Run a scan with Malwarebytes

Use Malwarebytes on-demand scanner. 

### Step 5: Fix your web browser

Malware infections can damage Windows system files and other settings. One common malware trait is to modify your web browser's homepage to reinfect the PC, display advertisements, prevent browsing, and gernally annoy you. 
Before launching you web browser, check you homepage and connection settings. Simply got to the settings window of you browser to check your homepage setting.

### Step 6: Recover your files if Windows is corrupt

If you can't seem to remove the malware or if Windows isn't working properly, you may have to reinstall Windows. But before wiping your hard drive, copy all of your files to an external USB or flash drive. If you chekc your email with a client program, make sure you export your settings and messages to save them as well. Remember, you can't save installed programs. Instead, you'll have to reinstall the programs from discs or redownload them.

### Step 7: Keep your PC clean

Always make sure that you have a real-time anitvirus program running on your PC, and make sure this program is always up to date. Norton Security Premium is a recommended choice.
