# GitHub

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. This lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Creating a repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a “README” file, a file with information about your project.

**Steps:**
1. In upper-right corner of any page, use the + drop-down menu, and select New Repository
2. Type in the name of your repository
3. In the description box, write a short description.
4. Select Add a “README” file
5. Click Create Repository
 
## Creating a branch

Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time. By default, your repository has one branch named “main” that is the definitive branch. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them back to “main”.
When you create a branch off the “main” branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of “main” as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the “main” branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

**Steps:**
1. Click the Code tab of your repository
2. Click the drop-down at the top of the file list that says main.
3. Type a branch name, “readme-edits” into the text box
4. Click Create branch: readme-edits from main
 
## Making and committing changes

You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

**Steps:**
1. Click the “README.md” file.
2. Click the pencil icon to edit the file.
3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4. In the Commit changes box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
5. Click Commit changes
 
## Opening a pull request

A pull request is the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished. GitHub has a “@mention” feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.

## Merging your pull request

The final step is to merge the edited branch into the “main” branch.

**Steps:**
1. Click Merge pull request to merge the changes into “main”
2. Click Confirm merge
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, by clicking Delete branch.
               
# VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VS code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs from your browser. VS code is a small download by design and only includes the minimum number of components shared across most development workflows. There isn’t a File > New Project dialog with pre-installed project templates. Most VS Code users will need to install additional components depending on their specific needs.
Common used components are:
* Git
* Node.js
* TypeScript
* Python
* Jupyter
* C/C++
* Live Server

VS Code has a navigation bar above the contents called Breadcrumbs. It shows the current location and allows you to quickly navigate between folders, files and symbols.
