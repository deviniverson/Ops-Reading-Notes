# How to Troubleshoot

Problem solving is a large part of working in IT. This troubleshooting process can not only solve problems you'll have in IT, but they can be applied to problems that you'd solve in any environment. 

1. Identify all information. You need to completely understand what the problem might be. And if possible, you want to be able to recreate/duplicate the problem. Technology has problems that often have multiple symptoms. It's never just one thing. Example: error message, system is slow, and the screen turns blue. You need to document all of these so that you can understand what the total issue might be. End users that are dealing with this issue, will probably be very familiar with what happened before, during and after the issue arose. Make sure to ask a lot of questions to get a ton of details from their perspective. If things have been working fine for a long period of time and then suddenly they're not working properly any longer, then something might have changed with their environment. 

2. Second step: start thinking about what might have caused this problem. We can start with the most obvious issues. The simplest explanation is often the most likely. You need to consider every possible scenario, even the ones that might not be completely obvious. It is useful to make a list of what all of the possible problems might be. Start from the easy theories and see if those might help me resolve the problem quickly. We now can go to our list, working from the top and start testing the theories that might be causing this particular issue. If we get through our list and still haven't found an answer to our issue, it might be worthwhile to call an expert. 

3. Third step: Once you successfully identify which one of your theories actually solves the problem, then it's time to implement the solution. Sometimes this can be done very quickly, make a change and everything is back up and running. Other times you may have to make changes on a certain day at a certain time. Even the best-laid plans don't always work as expected, this is why it is smart to have a plan B or even a plan C. 

4. Fourth step: Once the fix is applied, you still have to test and make sure that your fix actually solved the problem. After testing the fix and everything looks good. It's time to create some preventative measures so that this problem doesn't occur in the future. Gather all very valuable information and store so if the issue ever were to arise, the documentation and steps taken would be available. You might want to consider creating a formal database for this information. You can always add information to and edit as needed.
