Role of the Help Desk Professional

# Role of the Help Desk Professional 

Customers and users depend on the IT staff to keep the system available and operational. The help desk professional is often the “face” of the IT staff that customers see and, right or wrong, customers often make judgments about the entire organization based on their interactions with a help desk professional. In addition to having a strong set of technical skills, help desk technicians also need to have a strong set of soft skills.
 
## Recognizing Required Skill Sets
 
## Hard skills include,
* Technical skills referring to the technician’s ability to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot IT systems. Higher level technicians need to have in-depth knowledge about the network infrastructure and servers operating within the organization.
* Security skills for understanding the relationship between vulnerabilities, threats, and risks that their organization could attract.
* Troubleshooting skills are the ability of identifying and resolving a problem.
* Business skills refers to the technician's understanding of the organization’s vision, mission, and values, in addition to the ability to use tools available within the organization. Successful technicians understand the elements of a business and their role within the business.
 
## Soft skills include,
* Ability to communicate effectively with others. Effective communication is extremely important in IT support roles. Two more important skills to have are using open-ended questions and active listening to be able to question the user to get adequate information on a problem without taking on a tone of interrogation.
* Personal skills referring to the ability to manage different situations and manage themselves. A core personal skill is attitude, which includes maintaining a positive attitude of service towards the customer.
* Strong written communication is crucial for help desk technicians for documenting their actions after they resolve an issue. This provides the next technician who is asked about the same issue a plan of attack to fix the issue.
* Help desk technicians also provide training to users so that the users can resolve problems on their own the next time they occur. This ability to work one-on-one with a customer to help them understand the product.
 
## Critical Thinking is another soft skill that makes a world of difference in job performance.
* Actively thinking, a person uses their intelligence, experience, knowledge, and skills to explore a problem and identify a solution.
* Asking themselves questions about a problem or challenge, and then seeking out the answer.
* Changing perspectives can help solve many problems, just by looking at them from a different perspective.
* Evaluating evidence or symptoms is critical to be able to use reason to evaluate existing facts to come to a substantiate conclusion.
