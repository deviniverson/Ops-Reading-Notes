## Goals of a security model:
Two primary objectives of information security within the organization from a risk management perspective include:
•	Have controls in place to support the mission of the organization
•	All the decisions should be based on the risk tolerance of the organization

## Strategy leads to tactics, tactics lead to operations
Strategic goals may refer to having all domains centrally administered and implementing VPNs and RADIUS servers to provide a highly secure environment that provides a good amount of assurance to the management and employees.

A security model has different layers, but it also has different types of goals to accomplish in different time frames:
•	Operational goals: Daily goals, or operational goals, focus on productivity and task-oriented activities to ensure the company’s functionality.
•	Tactical goals: Corresponding mid-term goals, or tactical goals, could involve moving computers into domains, installing firewalls, and segregating the network by creating a demilitarized zone.
•	Strategic goals: A long-term goal, or strategic goal, may involve moving all the branches from dedicated communication lines to frame relay, implementing IPsec virtual private networks (VPNs) for all remote users instead of dial-up entry.

## Security Fundamentals: CIA
1.	Confidentiality: Prevent unauthorized disclosure - Confidentiality of information refers to protecting the information from disclosure to unauthorized parties
2.	Integrity: Detect modification of information - Integrity of information denotes protecting sensitive information from being modified by unauthorized parties.
3.	Availability: Provide timely and reliable access to resources - Availability of information signifies ensuring that all the required or intended parties can access the information when needed. 

## Best Practices to support CIA
•	Separation of duties: Prevents any one person from becoming too powerful within an organization. This policy also provides singleness of focus.
•	Mandatory vacations: Prevents an operator from having exclusive use of a system. Periodically, that individual is forced to take a vacation and relegate control of the system to someone else. This policy is a detective control. 
•	Job Rotation: Similar in purpose to mandatory vacations, but with the added benefit of cross-training employees.
•	Least Privilege: Allowing users to have only the required access to do their jobs.
•	Need to Know: In addition to clearance, users must also have a “need to know” to access classified data.
•	Dual control: Requiring more than one user to perform a task.

## Following definitions are crucial for risk management:
•	Asset: Anything of value to the company
•	Vulnerability: A weakness, the absence of safeguard
•	Threat: Things that could pose a risk to all or part of an asset
•	Threat agent: the entity which carries out the attack
•	Exploit: An instance of compromise
•	Risk: The probability of a threat materializing
•	Controls: Physical, administrative, and technical protections (including both safeguards and countermeasures)
