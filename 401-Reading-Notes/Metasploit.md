# Metasploit

Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that makes hacking simple. It has essential tools for attackers and defenders. Direct Metasploit towards a target, pick your exploit, choose a payload to drop and hit Enter.

Metasploit framework is both free and libre software and comes pre-installed in Kali Linux. The framework offers only a command-line interface, but those wanting GUI-based click and drag hacking plus some other cool features can drop a bundle for per seat licenses to Metasploit Pro.

HD Moore began working on Metasploit written in Perl language and released 1.0 in 203. Security outfit Rapid7 acquired both Metasploit and Moore in 2009. Today, it is common for Metasploit to have zero day reports to include a Metasploit module as proof of concept.

## Using Metasploit
During information gathering phase of a pentest, Metasploit integrates seamlessly with Nmap, SNMP scanning and Windows patch enumeration. There is even a bridge to Nessus.
Once you find a weakness, hunt through Metasploit's large and extensible database for the exploit that will crack open your way in.
Pair your exploit with a payload to suit the task at hand.

More and more features are being added to Metasploit every year. This includes a fuzzer to identify potential security flaws in binaries, as well as a long list of auxiliary modules too long to list here.
