Compute domain can be defined as “anything that has CPU and Memory capacity that allows you to run an arbitrary piece of code written in a specific programming language.”

## Abstraction levels
The more abstraction levels are present, the more the cloud provider can add value and can offload the consumer from non-strategic activities. A lot of these activities tend to be “undifferentiated heavy lifting.” 
This is defined as something that AWS customers must do but that don’t necessarily differentiate them from their competitors. In supporting millions of customers on AWS requires a certain degree of flexibility in the services they offer because there are many different patterns, use cases, and requirements to satisfy. Giving customers choices is something AWS always strives for. 

## AWS has many services available (sorted by compute abstractions):
**Physical server:**
•	Bare Metal
**Virtual Machine:**
•	Amazon Lightsail
•	Amazon EC2
•	AWS Fargate
**Container:**
•	Amazon EKS
•	Amazon ECS
**Function:**
•	AWS Lambda

In general, customers tend to use higher-level services to get out of the business of managing non-differentiating activities.
