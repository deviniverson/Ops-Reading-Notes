## What is Penetration testing?
A penetration test is a simulated cyber-attack against your computer system to check for vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF).
A Pen test can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems to uncover vulnerabilities. Insights provided by the penetration test can be used to fine-tune your WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities.

### Penetration Testing Stages
1.	Planning and Reconnaissance: Define scope and goals of test, including systems to be addressed and testing methods to be used. Gather intelligence to better understand how a target works and its potential vulnerabilities
2.	Scanning: There are two steps to understanding how a target application will respond to intrusion attempts.
    a.	Static analysis- Inspects an application’s code to estimate the way it behaves while running.
    b.	Dynamic analysis- Inspects an application’s code in a running state, this provides a real-time view into an application’s performance.
3.	Gaining Access: This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors to uncover a target’s vulnerabilities
4.	Maintaining Access: This stage is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system, long enough for a bad actor to gain in-depth access.
5.	Analysis: The results of the penetration test are then compiled into a report detailing, specific vulnerabilities that were exploited, sensitive data that was accessed, and the amount of time the pen tester was able to remain in the system undetected. 

### Penetration Testing Methods
1. External Testing
2. Internal Testing
3. Blind Testing
4. Double-blind Testing
5. Targeted Testing
