## What are YARA rules?
They are rules you write and use to try to find malware in your system, kind of like a Google search for pieces of malware code.
YARA is a tool that you can use to track down malware in your computer or network. Attackers may reuse code in different malware campaigns and YARA rules can look for that code along with some of the malware's functions and features.

### For example:
Some attack groups sent phishing emails to restaurants, pretending they had eaten there and ended up getting sick. If you wanted to keep watch for these malware-laden emails at your own restaurant, you could write a YARA rule, with information such as key words from the nasty phishing messages.
When the phishing messages come in, you'll find them - in theory - before it's too late.

### YARA stands for "Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym" by its creator, Victor Alvarez.
