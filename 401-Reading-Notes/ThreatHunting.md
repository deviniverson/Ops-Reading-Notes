## Threat Hunting
Threat hunting is an active/proactive activity, we are going to see if there are any of our internal systems, not just desktops, but everything if it shows signs of being compromised. The Output of a threat hunt is meaning the result of what we get from a compromise assessment. Successful threat hunting is when we can say with reasonable certainty, all of our systems are in a pristine shape, or all of our systems look good, but we need to do further investigation on these one or two that may be in a compromised state.

## Why you need threat hunting
When you look at existing security tools today, they fall into one of two groups:
1. Protection based - this is how we keep the bad people out
2. Response based - this is how we get the bad people off our network
