# CIS Benchmarks

CIS Benchmarks are a collection of best practices for securely configuring IT systems, software, networks, and cloud infrastructure. They are published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). There are more than 140 CIS Benchmarks in total, spanning across seven core technology categories.

## How are CIS Bechmarks organized?
Each CIS Benchmark includes multiple configuration recommendations based on one of two profile levels.
* Level 1 profiles: cover base-level configurations that are easier to implement and have minimal impact on business functionality.

* Level 2 profiles: intended for high-security environments and require more coordination and planning to implement with minimal business disruption.

There are seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks:
1. **Operating system benchmarks**, covering security configurations of core operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple OSX.
2. **Server software benchmarks**, covering security configurations of widely used server software, including Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, VMware, Docker, and Kubernetes.
3. **Cloud provider benchmarks**, address security configurations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM, and other popular public clouds.
4. **Mobile device benchmarks**, address mobile operating systems, including IOS and Android.
5. **Network device benchmarks**, offer general and vendor-specific security configurations guidelines for network devices and applicable hardware from Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Juniper, and others.
6. **Desktop software benchmarks**, covers security configurations for some of the most commonly used desktop software applications, including Microsoft Office and Exchange Server, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari Browser.
7. **Multi-function print device benchmarks**, outline security best practices for configuring multi-function printers in office settings and cover such topics as firmware updating, TCP/IP configurations, wireless access configuration.
