# Cybersecurity Automation

Cybersecurity products designed to automate specific processes are widespread, and the likelihood is that you have already implemented automation tools within your organization. Vulnerability management products can be configured to automatically detect and scan devices on an enterprise network. They can then conduct an assessment based upon a set of security controls authorized by the organization. Identified defects can be remediated.

When discussing new automation practices, industry experts are generally referring to tools like security automation and orchestration (SOAR) products, robotic process automation (RPA) and custom-developed software and code that automate processes and perform analysis.

* ** SOAR ** products are purpose -built tools that orchestrate activities between other security tools and perform specific automation activities in response to identified threats.
* ** RPA ** tools are a broader set of automation tools that allow for a wide variety of processes to be automated. RPA tools are usually adopted in HR and finance fields but have been leveraged by cybersecurity teams.
* ** Custom-developed software and code ** can automate all manner of analyses and is often leveraged for a niche or specific challenge within an organization that may not have an out of box tool available.


## Why Cybersecurity Automation?
Many organizations inspect systems and data manually for evidence of unexpected behavior and indicators of compromise or defect. Pairing with human error and the insurmountable amount of data to manage, it is inevitable that a potential threat will slip through the cracks. It is simply unrealistic to expect human teams to catch potential cybersecurity events reliably. Implementing automation could be vital in order to reliably protect your organization and ensure resilience through robust and repeatable processes.

## What is the Benefit of Automation?
By implementing automation in an organization's environment, the cybersecurity team can focus on activities that are more complex. This means that the machine can perform the mundane, repeatable work and the cybersecurity team members can devote themselves to more critical, creative and technical work to resolve issues and improve the organizational risk posture.

* Remediation Activities
* Automation Development and Engineering

### Three basic approaches to successfully implement automation concepts include:
1. Embed development capabilities in your cybersecurity team. In this way, developers report directly to cyber leadership
2. Partner cybersecurity with organizational development teams
3. Adopt a hybrid approach. Utilize an internal team for tactical development work and organizational development capabilities for complex integration tasks.
