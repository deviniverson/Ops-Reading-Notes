## What is a Security Operation Center(SOC)?
Security Operation Center also called an information security operations center(ISOC), is a centralized location where an information security tema monitors, detects, analyzes and responds to cyber security incidents. Typically on a 24/7/365 basis.
The security team, which consists of both security analysts and engineers, oversees all activity on servers, databases, networks, applications, endpoint devices, websites and other systems for the sole purpose of pinpointing potential security threats and thwarting them as quickly as possible.
On a larger scale, there are also Global Security Operations Centers(GSOC), coordinating security officers that literally span the globe.

## Importance of a SOC
Simply put, SOCs offer assurance that threats will be detected and prevented in real time. Looking at a big-picture perspective, SOCs can:
* Respond Faster: The SOC provides a centralized, complete, real-time view of how the entire infrastructure is performing from a security standpoint, even if you have several locations and thousands of endpoints.
* Protect consumer and customer trust: Consumers are already skeptical of most companies and are worried about their privacy. Creating a SOC to protect consumer and customer data can help build trust in your organization.
* Minimize costs: While many organizations think establishing a SOC is cost prohibitive, the costs associated with a breach - including the loss of data, corrupted data or customer defection - are much higher.

## What does a SOC do?
A high-functioning SOC will provide:
* Proactive, around the clock surveillance of networks, hardware and software for threat and breach detection.
* Expertise on all the tools your organization uses, including third party vendors, to ensure they can easily resolve security issues.
* Installation, updating and troubleshooting of application software.
* Monitoring and managing of firewall and intrusion prevention systems.
* Scanning and remediation of antivirus, malware and ransomware solutions.
* Email, voice and video traffic
* Patch management and whitelisting
* Deep analysis of security log data from various sources
* Investigation of security breaches to understand the root cause of attacks and prevent future breaches.
* Enforcement of security policies and procedures
* Backup, storage and recovery
