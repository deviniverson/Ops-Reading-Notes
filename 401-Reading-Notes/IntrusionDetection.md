# Pros & Cons of Intrusion Detection Systems
A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) can be an integral part of an organization's security, but they are just one aspect of many in a cohesive and safe system.

## What is an Intrusion Detection System?
Intrusion Detection Systems are a lot like fire alarms. Just as a fire alarm detects smoke, an intrusion detection system identifies incidents and potential threats. THey are incredibly useful for raising awareness. While a firewall is there to keep out malicious attacks, an IDS is there to detect whether someone or something is trying to do suspicious or nefarious activity. When it detects something, it notifies the systems administrator. An IDS is a visibility tool that sits off to the side of the network and monitors traffic. It consists of a management console and sensors.

## Intrusion Detection Systems vs Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
IPS is similar to an IDS, except that they are able to block potential threats as well. They monitor, log and report activities, similarly to an IDS, but they are also capable of stopping threats without the systems administrator getting involved. If an IPS is not tuned correctly, it can also deny legitimate traffic, so they are not suitable for all applications.

## Pros of Network Intrusion Detection Systems:
* They can be tuned to specific content in Network Packets
* They can look at data in the context of the protocol
* They can qualify and Quantify attacks
* They can make it easier to keep up with regulation
* They can boost efficiency

## Cons of Network Intrusion Detection Systems:
* They will not prevent incidents by themselves
* An experienced engineer is needed to administer them
* They do not process encrypted packets
* IP packets can still be faked
* False Positives are frequent
* They are susceptible to protocol based attacks
* The Signature Library needs to be continually updated to detect the latest threats
