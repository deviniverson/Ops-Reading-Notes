## What is the Empire?
The Empire is a post-exploitation framework used by hackers of all hats.
Empire was released in 2015 at the BSides Las Vegas security conference to show how Powershell could be used beyond the infection stage of an attack. It is an open-source and modular architecture allowing it to grow and fulfill the needs of offensive security teams.
Over time, numerous exploit modules were added to the framework for various hacking needs, and a Python agent for Linux and macOS systems.

### Empire used for malicious use
1. APT group Hades used Empire in its Olympic Destroyer campaign during the 2018 edition of the Winter Olympics in South Korea.
2. At the end of 2018, the FIN7 cybercrime group also started to rely on the Empire framework, not just on the Cobalt Strike threat emulation software.
3. Threat actors used it with increased frequency in high-profile ransomware incidents. Trickbot and Drixex botnets that use Empire for network exploitation and lateral movement to deliver Ryuk and BitPaymer file-encrypting malware.
