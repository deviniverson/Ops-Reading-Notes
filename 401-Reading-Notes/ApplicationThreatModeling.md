## What is threat modeling?
Threat modeling works to identify, communicate and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value. A threat model is a structured representation of all the information that affects the security of an application.

### Threat modeling can be applied to:
* Software
* Applications
* Systems
* Networks
* Distributed systems
* Internet of Things (IoT) devices
* Business processes

### A threat model typically includes:
* Description of the subject to be modeled
* Assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
* Potential threats to the system
* Actions that can be taken to mitigate each threat
* A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken

Threat modeling is a process for capturing, organizing, and analyzing all of the information.

## Threat Modeling: Four Question Framework
* What are we working on?
* What can go wrong?
* What are we going to do about it?
* Did we do a good job?

### It is helpful to refine the search space in order to determine which possible threats to focus on.
* Assess Scope: This might be as small as a sprint, or as large as a whole system.
* Identify what can go wrong: Simple as brainstorming or as structured as using STRIDE, Kill Chains, or Attack Trees
* Identify countermeasures or manage risk: Decide what you're going to do about each threat. That might be to implement a mitigation, or to apply the accept/ transfer/ eliminate approaches of risk management.
* Assess your work: Did you do a good enough job for the system at hand?

Done right, threat modeling provides a clear "line of sight" across a project that justifies security efforts.
