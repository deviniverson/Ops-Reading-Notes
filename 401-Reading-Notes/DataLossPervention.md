# What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?

Data Loss prevention (DLP) is a set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users. DLP software classifies regulated, confidential and business critical data and identifies violations of policies defined by organizations or within a predefined policy pack, typically driven by regulatory compliance such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR.

Data loss prevention software and tools monitor and control endpoint activities, filter data streams on corporate networks, and monitor data in the cloud to protect data at rest, in motion, and in use. DLP also provides reporting to meet compliance and auditing requirements and identify areas of weakness and anomalies for forensics and incident response.

## Three Main Uses Cases for Data Loss Prevention
1. **Personal Information Protection / Compliance: **If an organization collects and stores Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), or payment card information (PCI). Then you are most likely subject to compliance regulations, such as HIPAA (for PHI) and GDPR (for personal data of EU residents), that require you to protect your customers' sensitive data. DLP can identify, classify, and tag sensitive data and monitor activities and events surrounding the data.
2. **IP Protection: **If an organization has important intellectual property and trade or state secrets that could put their organization's financial health and brand image at risk if lost or stolen. DLP solutions like Digital Guardian that use context-based classification can classify intellectual property in both structured and unstructured forms. With policies and controls in place, you can protect against unwanted exfiltration of this data.
3. **Data Visibility: **If an organization is seeking to gain additional visibility into data movement, a comprehensive enterprise DLP solution can help them see and track their data on endpoints, networks, and the cloud. This is provided with visibility into how individual users with the organization interact with data.

## Seven Trends Driving DLP Adoption
1. The Growth of the CISO Role
2. Evolving Compliance Mandates
3. More Places to Protect the Data
4. Data breaches are Frequent and Large
5. Organization's Stolen Data is Worth More
6. There's More Data to Steal
7. There's a Security Talent Shortage

## Data Loss Prevention Best Practices:
* Determine your primary data protection objective
* Determine the most appropriate DLP deployment architecture or combination of architectures
* Buy-in from other executives
* Establish your evaluation criteria
* Clearly define the roles and responsibilities
* Start with a clearly defined quick win
* Work together with business unit heads
* Document your processes carefully
* Define success metrics and share reporting with business leaders
