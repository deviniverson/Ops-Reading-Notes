## Definition of Data in Transit vs Data at Rest
Data in transit, or data in motion, is data actively moving from one location to another such as across the internet or through a private network.
Data at rest is data that is not actively moving from device to device or network to network such as data stored on a hard drive, laptop, flash drive, or archived/stored in some other way. Data protection at rest aims to secure inactive data stored on any device or network.
Protecting sensitive data both in transit and at rest is imperative for modern enterprises as attackers find increasingly innovative ways to compromise systems and steal data.

## Role of Encryption in Data Protection in Transit and at Rest
Data can be exposed to risks both in transit and at rest and requires protection in both states. Multiple different approaches to protecting data in transit and at rest. Encryption plays a major role in data protection and is a popular tool for securing data both in transit and at rest.
For protecting data in transit, enterprises often choose to encrypt sensitive data prior to moving and/or use encrypted connections(HTTPS, SSL, TLS, FTPS, etc) to protect the contents of data in transit.
For protecting data at rest, enterprises can simply encrypt sensitive files prior to storing them and/or choose to encrypt the storage drive itself.

## Best Practices for Data Protection in Transit and at Rest
Unprotected data, whether in transit or at rest, leaves enterprises vulnerable to attack, but there are effective security measures that offer robust data protection across endpoints and networks.
* Implement robust network security controls to help protect data in transit.
* Don't rely on reactive security to protect your valuable company data.
* Create policies for systematically categorizing and classifying all company data, no matter where it resides.
