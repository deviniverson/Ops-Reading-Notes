## Who are Computer Forensic Specialists?
Computer forensic specialists investigate security issues, data breaches, and other cyber crimes. These experts recover documents, photos, emails, and other files from computer systems, hard drives, and other devices. They also focus on helping organizations deal with network breaches. Forensic specialists will help determine how a breach happened in a computer system - the main focus of their experts is to look at digital breaches and hacks that have already happened, and learn from them for the future.

### Computer Forensics vs cybersecurity
At the root, cybersecurity is focused on prevention while computer forensics is more reactionary in nature. Cybersecurity experts work to keep hackers out and harden systems, while computer forensics experts focus on how to move forward once a hacker has gotten in.
