## Site-to-Site VPN
A site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) refers to a connection set up between multiple networks. Site-to-site VPNs are useful for companies that prioritize private, protected traffic and are particularly helpful for organizations with more than one office spread out over large geographical locations. A site-to-site VPN can give all sites full access to the application - as if it were housed within their physical facility.
VPNs were first made possible through the use of the original packet switching network named Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), as well as the initial uses of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
* TCP/IP outlines how data is organized according to packets, given addresses, transmitted, and received across different computers on the internet. Before the internet was launched as we know it today, computers were connected between sites through a private network and TCP/IP. In this way, site-to-site networks predated the internet, forming the foundation for what we have today.
Modern iteration of a VPN gained popularity because of people wanting to mask their IP addresses and surf the internet more safely. A hidden IP address gives you the freedom to download torrents without revealing who you are. You can also gain access to geo-blocked content, regardless of your location. In addition, on a public network, you have to deal with a constant barrage of cyberattacks, but with a VPN, you can enjoy a more secure, encrypted connection. These attributes made private VPNs a top choice among individual users.

## Understanding VPN and its Types
* Remote Access VPNs - a temporary connection set up between two or more users and a central location. In most cases, a remote access VPN is used to give each location access to a data center. A remote access VPN is a useful tool for companies with remote workers either on the road or in their homes.
* Intranet-based Site-to-Site - connects more than one local-area network (LAN) to form a wide-area network (WAN). A company may also use this kind of setup to incorporate software-defined WAN (SD-WAN). Intranet-based site-to-site VPNs are useful tools for combining resources housed in disparate offices securely, as if they were all in the same physical location.
* Extranet-based Site-to-Site - often used by two or more different companies that want to share certain resources but keep others private. Each entity connects to the VPN and chooses what they want to make available to the other companies. In this way, they can collaborate and share without exposing proprietary data.
