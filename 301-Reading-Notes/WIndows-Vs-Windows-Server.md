## Windows 10 and Windows Server share Similar Code

Both Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, look very similar with the same desktop. They use the same kernel and can feasibly run the same software. You can install Google Chrome or Microsoft Office on both. The similarities stop there.

Windows 10 was designed for use as a desktop you sit in front of, and Windows Server as a server that runs services people access across a network. Microsoft recommends installing Windows Server without a Graphical User Interface (GUI), leaving just a command line to work which reduces the overhead needed to run the server. This includes a push to use Nano Server, which drops the GUI and local login capabilities in exchange for using far less space than the standard Server install.

## Windows Server Includes Server Software

With GUI enabled, moments after Windows Server loads, a Server Manager program launches showing the first distinct difference in the two Operating Systems. Here you can add on server-specific features like Windows Deployment services, DHCP services, and Active Directory Domain Services. These features allow deployment of an OS remotely to other machines, the creation of static IP address for client machines, control of a network domain for joining other computers on the domain and creating domain users.

## Windows Server Supports High-End Hardware

Windows Server supports more powerful hardware. While Windows 10 Pro has a max limit of 2 TB of RAM, Windows Server allows for 24 TB. Windows 10 has a limit on processors as well. Windows 10 Home edition only supports one physical CPU, while Windows 10 Pro supports two. Server 2016 supports up to 64 sockets.

## Windows Server is Locked Down

Windows Server has several features removed such as Cortana, Microsoft Store, Edge, or Timeline. Windows Server is still using Internet Explorer and is locked down to hinder normal web browsing.

## Windows Server is More Expensive than Windows 10

You can install Windows 10 for free. Windows Server 2016 licenses aren’t easy to buy and they’re expensive. For a business depending on your size and needs a single license can cost between $500 and $6200. Most purchasers use a Volume License route instead.
