## Microsoft Patch Tuesday

Microsoft's "Patch Tuesday" occurs on the second Tuesday of each month. This is when Microsoft releases large update packages for Windows 10, Windows 7, Microsoft Office, and its other software.

Sometimes called "Update Tuesday," Patch Tuesday is an unofficial term for the day when Microsoft releases update packages for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft software applications. As Microsoft patches security vulnerabilities, it doesn't release those patches immediately. Instead, the company gathers those fixes into a larger update, which is released on Patch Tuesday. 

Microsoft does this to make the update process as predictable as possible for administrators. IT professionals know that patches will arrive on the second Tuesday of each month, and they can make plans to test or install them. It should be easier than continually applying smaller patches and more predictable than huge patches arriving on a random day of the month.

## Updates Aren't Only Released on Tuesday
As you might have noticed, Patch Tuesday isn't the only date updates arrive. In some cases, Microsoft will issue "out-of-band" updates for particularly critical security flaws, especially ones that are being exploited in the wild. If a security hole isn't being exploited in the wild and it's okay to wait a few weeks, Microsoft will wait for Patch Tuesday to issue that update. Even if you do get one or more smaller patches in a month, there's always a bigger update coming on Patch Tuesday. It contains all the updates that didn't have to be rushed out.

Microsoft calls Patch Tuesday updates as "B" updates because they're released on the second week of each month. Microsoft also issues optional update packages in the third and fourth weeks of the month. They are known as the "C" and "D" updates. These include bug fixes and improvements for problems that aren't security holes. After these updates are tested, their fixes make it into the next month's B update on Patch Tuesday. C and D updates appear as "optional updates" in Windows Update on Windows 10.
